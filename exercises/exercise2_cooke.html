            <!------------------------------- This is the first question --------------------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The typeface used throughout the website has an artistic feel and provides easily legible body copy, but I do not feel that it fits the somber feel of the music or the visuals presented in the most of the images. The pull quotes and headline are much to large, toned down slightly but with a definitive hierarchy would have been fine. The Headline itself was rather lengthy, should have been edged back to something small and catchy a hook that drags the reader. Bite size.</p>
            <!------------------------------- This is the second question --------------------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The stark black on white and subdued palate lend to the melancholy of the musical sound. However the rose/white on deep violet-purple is off-putting, not sure how this fits into their overall vision of the web page.</p>
            <!------------------------------- This is the third question --------------------------------->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals also play into the feel of the page and are indicative of the two pieces that were presented to us, however the both video detracts from that feel as the individuals appear animated and comical.</p>
            <!------------------------------- This is the fourth question --------------------------------->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>Sections were distinctly marked by images or video, an occasional colorbar, the website followed a liner path through the body copy, however the callouts did more to distract than to reestablish attention to the body copy or reaffirm interest.</p>
