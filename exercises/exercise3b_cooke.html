        <h1>Daftpunk Website Analysis</h1>
        <h3> <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/daft-punk/"><b>http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/daft-punk/</b></a></h3>

            <!------------------------------- This is the first question --------------------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>There were several distinct and contrasting typeface choices, too many in my own opinion as 2-3 being a standard. The headline typeface is an artistic choice to play off the album, and only used once. The paragraph indicators were san-serif while the body copy was serif, this allows for easy visual distinction. I did not care for the animated pullouts, they were intentional and directed the viewer to the overarching theme and techno style of the band’s music, but were overall very hard to read and distracting.</p>
            <!------------------------------- This is the second question --------------------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The color palate varied as you continued through the site. Beginning warm and cool color combinations it quickly jumped to HD and stark contrast with only a hint of color, then to a dawn to dusk and back again background. The color choices again were intention, depicting the duality of fire and water, which were also represented in the helmet (gold and reflected sky).</p>
            <!------------------------------- This is the third question --------------------------------->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals offset the body copy segments and give indication of progression in the piece. The visuals were overtly large, but not distracting as they are consistent throughout the site. The use of video at the beginning and end create an opening and closing.</p>
            <!------------------------------- This is the fourth question --------------------------------->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>The images change rapidly as you scroll through the body copy (marking passage), but as in the previous analysis, they did little more than provide you with an occasional pullout or draw attention the bands wardrobe. More visuals the depict the feel of the music or that even show the band in their typical DJ set up might have lent better to providing information to the viewer that hasn’t experience their music or energy.</p>
