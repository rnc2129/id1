                <li>What adjectives would you use to describe the design of this site?
                    <p>Somber</p>
                    <p>Tragic</p>
                    <p>Pleading</p></li>
                <li> Describe how the navigation for this “story” works.
                    <ul>On a chapter page, what is the visual cue for you to go to the next chapter.
                        <p>The initial page utilizes hover with cursor change to indicate that you may select a chapter. After the initial chapter selection you are indicated to "scroll down to begin accompanied with a red animated arrow</p></ul>
                    <ul>Do you ever feel lost while browsing this story? Why or why not?
                        <p>I did not feel lost, however the "next chapter navigation could have been a little larger</p>
                    </ul>
                <li>How does the ending for Chapter 3 differ from the endings for the other 2 chapters?</li>
                <p>The third chapter end with links to other sections, and how to like and share.</p>
                <li>What do you think the creators of this site hoped to accomplish?</li>
                <P>The designer of this page wanted to create an uneasy feeling. The use of oversized images and underwhelming body-copy size sets the viewer off balance. The use of grey values and reds also creates a feeling of impending doom. Lastly everything has an intention gritty feel.</P>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>What adjectives would you use to describe the design of this site?
                    <p>Colorful</p>
                    <p>Light</p>
                    <p>Clean</p></li>
                <li> Describe how the navigation for this page works.
                    <ul>What pages are in the navigation?</ul>
                    <p>On a main pagethere are three page indicators "Explore", "History" and "Future". However the branding logo in the upper left and lack of a hover feature caused initial confusion.</p>
                    <ul>Do you ever feel lost while browsing this story? Why or why not?</ul>
                    <p>Yes, as I stated above there was some confusion, also the fact that the branding logo is also the "home" link, but is disabled on the landing page is a little odd.</p>
                <li>Do the page names in the navigation seem appropriate for the content on these pages?</li>
                <p>The page links do indicate the content well but I would have liked to see a better indicator or hint that they are links.</p>
                <li>What do you think the creators of this site hoped to accomplish?</li>
                <P>To raise awareness of the Elizabeth River Trail and to promote voulenteers to help develop new aspects to the trail</P>
