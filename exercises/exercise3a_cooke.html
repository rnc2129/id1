            <!------------------------------- This is the first question --------------------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>Consistent typeface throughout the body copy and pullouts create a unified site. The body copy was easy to read and clearly thought out from the formatting stance.</p>
            <!------------------------------- This is the second question --------------------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The vivid colors are a good contrast with the black and white images (colorized) and the body copy. The colors are not distracting and create a upbeat feel for the site. Although the moving visuals lend to the feel of the page I found them overbearing and obnoxiously large.</p>
            <!------------------------------- This is the third question --------------------------------->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals create earmarks in the reading and provide a natural pause between segments of the body copy. The visuals are however too similar. They show the band member is the same repetitive poses and provide no interaction as to what each does within the band.</p>
            <!------------------------------- This is the fourth question --------------------------------->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>There are clear and easily identifiable breaks in sections signified by color usage, images, as well as emphasis in the body copy. Bold text marking new paragraphs and images to mark progression in the read.</p>
