        <h1>The State of the World.</h1>
        <h3>What do you love about the state of the world today?</h3>                               
        <p><em>The current state of the world today is fluid and dynamic. Depending on where you are (physical location) the state of the world is different, which changes your perception and perspective.</em></p>  
        <h3>What do you hate about the state of the world today?</h3>
        <p><em>We are a world, a nation, and a people divided. We have so many commanalities that we could focus on, and yet as a populous we focus on our difference.</em></p>
        <h3>What about it do you wish you could change about the state of the world today?</h3>
        <p><em>If i could change one thing about the state of the world today I would change tollerance. Not the tollerance where everyone is told what they cannot do because it might offend others, but the tollerance that allows others to accept that others have different ideas and that it is ok to hold these beliefs.</em></p>
