            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <!----- QUESTION 1 ------------------------------------------->
            <p id="question">Tell me about your path to becoming a designer</p>
            <p id="answer">At age 43, having spent the greater part of my life in as a soldier in the Army, I decided to change my career focus. Having experience in illustration, construction, drafting and working as a Battalion Graphics Noncommissioned Officer, I felt it in my best interest pursue a Multimedia Graphic Design trajectory.</p>
            <p id="answer">In 2014 I began studies at Tidewater Community College Visual Arts Center under the Applied Associates of Arts: Multimedia Graphic Design program. Currently I am three classes shy of completing this degree, however, these are stacked pre-requisits and it will take me another two semesters to complete.</p>
            <p id="answer">Concurrent to this degree focus I am augmenting and honing my talents in the Studio Arts areas. Currently I have completed or enrolled in courses in Watercolor I, Painting I, and Wheel Thrown Pottery. My philosophy for attending these disciplines is simple, if I understand the process for these in the physical form I can translate these talents to the digital format.</p>
            <!----- QUESTION 2 ------------------------------------------->
            <p id="question">Tell me about your aspirations as a designer</p>
            <p id="answer">My aspirations as a designer fall into three benchmark goals: Present, Short Term, Long Term.</p>
            <p = id="answer">Present Goals - Continue to develop my skill sets and hone my knowledge of the technical aspects of Multimedia Graphic Design, this phase will end upon receipt of an Applied Associates Degree of Art: Multimedia Graphic Design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short Term Goals -</strong> Work in an internship or apprentice in the Graphic Design community while continuing on a glide-path towards a bachelor degree in Multimedia Design.</li>
                <li><strong>Long Term Goals -</strong> Work in any capacity within the Multiimedia Graphic Design or Graphic Design community.</li>
