        <h3><strong>Phase 1-2: Selection and Essay.</strong></h3>
        <img src= "images/brainstorm.jpg" id="bs" alt="Brainstorming Notes">
        <p>Wrote out several of the bands that I know that I continually revisit and listen as well as what bands have been my music inventory for the longest time. Narrowed these two lists by cross referencing and then choosing based on specific memories and events attached to songs or bands.</p>
        <p>Created a rough outline (mind map) of the two different methods to my essay. Researched details that I wanted to convey and created citation notes.</p>
        <p>Wrote the essay in short informative first person style to portray a personal feel to the material. By writing about personal events and past experiences I provided a connection that readers could relate to before switching over to descriptive information on the band and their style.</p>
        <p id="brain">Peer review conducted which caught several grammatical and spelling mistakes which were corrected.</p>

        <h3><strong>Phase 3: Wireframe and Moodboards.</strong></h3>
        <img src= "images/wireframe2a.png" id="wf" alt="Wirefrae Design" >
        <p>Researched several music band sites as well as several blog posts for content and visual style. Found that most had a straight forward linear hierarchy and visual presentation and most of the content was fairly narrative.</p>
        <p>I had missed class instruction on wireframes so I researched the slides from class as well as several websites devoted to wireframe and industry standards. Chose to download a wireframe application to expedite the process and provide ease of manipulation rather than resetting each new idea.</p>
        <p>Created a wireframe based on visual appeal from several of the music websites. However, my actual design would morph to be more of a blog style visual as we learned more about coding and found that many of my ideas would be too time consuming at my present level of coding. </p>
        <p>I started with three idea words: Energetic, Divers and Tribal, which describes the feel and look of the band. I selected two photos one from the beginning of their career and one from their final farewell concert to bookend the essay and chose typeface that would complement each other and be legible while playing on major themes the band has used throughout the years (bones). Lastly I selected a logo (not depicted – that the fans could easily recognize) and would used this as the color scheme, however they did not lend to the overall appeal of the mood board.</p>
        <p id="secondary">I created a second mood board in a distinctly different style. I chose a different band logo and typeface. Serif for the Headlines and drop caps, and san-serif for the body copy, display typeface for pullouts and title. Retro, Eclectic and Rhythmic were the descriptive words, and the mood board was just that…I was not happy. In the end it was a combination of the two that would become the focus of the design.</p>

        <h3><strong>Phase Phase 4: Coding.</strong></h3>
        <img src= "images/coding.png" id="cd" alt="Basic Coding" width="100" height="140"> 
        <p>The construction was an eclectic process, with elements being added and tweaked up until the last few hours before class. I started with the simple html document we originally created in phase one, this would be the skeleton framework that I would adjust and build upon. I proceeded to add visual elements (photos) to the appropriate spots as well as logos to break up the paragraphs.</p>
        <p>Now that the basic items were in place and everything was in the proper order I began work on the CSS portion of the page where I would adjust the sizing of items and how much of the page they will hold. Continually working the sizes and padding to create a nicely stacked liner page.</p>
        <p>Once everything was in place I adjusted the typeface; display type for the title and pullout and a simple san-serif as contrast for the body copy. I also added in links on the photos and citations that would take the reader to the appropriate pages, as well as links on the logos as Easter eggs, linking to more videos from the band.</p>

        <h3><strong>Take Away: What I learned.</strong></h3>
        <img src= "images/finalpage.png" id="fp" alt="Final Page View"width="100" height="140"> 
        <p>Overall I am pleased with the development of my first attempt at creating a webpage, I enjoyed the process and really have a better understanding of the steps used to get from point A to point B. I found that having clear body copy created first really sped up the process as I had an idea where I was going from the start. The mood board were helpful to help me remain focused, however I also found that I was limited in what I wanted to do by my lack of knowledge of available attributes. My take away for this project is that to create a fully immersive and stunning webpage I will need a greater amount time in just coding and playing with the available effects to get a grasp on the resources available.
